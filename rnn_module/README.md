# Note

This module includes code from a private GitHub repository by Janik Fechtelpeter, used for applying RNN models in the enhanced evaluation of control strategies. Specifically, it supports the scripts:

- `myutils.py`
- `comparison_forecasting_accuracy.py`  
- `comparison_prediction_accuracy_ratio_trainlen.py`  
- `evaluate_control_strategies.py`

To respect the privacy of the original repository, the source files are **not included** in this public repository.
